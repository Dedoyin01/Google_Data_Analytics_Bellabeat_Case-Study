This is a Case Study from the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Program. This project showcases all that i have learned and my ability to implement the six phases of the data process (ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, act) and how to use the technical tools (Spreadsheet, SQL, Tableau, and R). 
For this Project I used the R programming language to organize and visualize the Data. Also showcase my approach to answering some of the business questions and solving the problem of the capstone project.
